> without a sync option, the last video frame is frozen to wait for audio

![](stopwatch.mp4)

This is going to be a slightly longer narration, so the video stopwatch will run out of time, but the last frame will wait for me to finish speaking.

One, Two, Three.

![match](stopwatch.mp4)

One, Two, Three.

One, Two, Three

  file: stopwatch.mp4
  sync: trim
  segment: 0 - 2)

(video:

This video will loop to match the duration of my sentence, so I can speak for as long as I want.
